# Video Audio Replacement with MoviePy

This script utilizes the MoviePy library to replace the audio track of a video file with another audio file.

## Installation

Before running the script, you need to install the MoviePy library. You can install it via pip:

```
pip install moviepy
```

## Usage

1. Import necessary modules from the MoviePy library.
2. Load the video file and the audio file into separate clip objects.
3. Create a new composite audio clip by combining the audio track of the video clip with the audio clip from the MP3 file.
4. Replace the original audio of the video clip with the new composite audio clip.
5. Write the modified video to a new file.

## Example

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, AudioFileClip, CompositeAudioClip

# Load the video file
videoclip = VideoFileClip("blood.mp4")

# Load the audio file
audioclip = AudioFileClip("despacito1.mp3")

# Create a new composite audio clip by combining the audio tracks
new_audioclip = CompositeAudioClip([videoclip.audio, audioclip])

# Replace the original audio of the video clip with the new composite audio clip
videoclip.audio = new_audioclip

# Write the modified video to a new file
videoclip.write_videofile("output6.mp4")
```

Make sure to replace `"blood.mp4"` and `"despacito1.mp3"` with the paths to your video and audio files.
